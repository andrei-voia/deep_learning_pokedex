## Input varieties

This application can find what pokemon is in a picture from a variety of inputs, like:

* Webcam - you can show a picture of a pokemon (show a piece of paper, a picture from a smartphone or pretty much anyway you can think of) through a webcam and the algorithm will tell you what pokemon is in that image.
* Image - you can give the path to a local image from your PC / Raspberry Pi to the Pokedex and it will tell you what pokemon is in that picture.
* Video - you can give the path to a local video, and whenever you want to analyze a frame, you can press the button and the Pokedex will tell you what pokemon is in that frame.
